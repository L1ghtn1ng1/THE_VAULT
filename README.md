## Features
- **Secure Password Storage**: All saved passwords are encrypted and safely stored, preventing unauthorized access even if the storage files are accessed directly.
- **Random Password Generator**: Generate strong, unique passwords whenever needed.
- **Easy Retrieval**: Each password is stored with an associated name, making it easy to find and retrieve specific credentials.

## Installation
No dependencies are required. The project can be run immediately with Python installed on your machine.

## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., VS Code).
3. Set up a **4-digit PIN** when prompted—this PIN will serve as your login key for future access to THE_VAULT.
4. Use the app to add, retrieve, and manage passwords.

## How to Run
1. Open the project in an IDE such as Visual Studio Code.
2. Locate `main.py`, then run it as a Python file.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts in the terminal to set your initial 4-digit PIN.
4. Once set, you can begin adding, managing, and generating passwords securely.

## Security
THE_VAULT uses encryption to protect all stored passwords. Encrypted data cannot be accessed or read directly from storage files without logging into the application with your secure PIN.

## Future Enhancements
- **Encrypt PIN and Add Change Option**: Improve security by encrypting the PIN itself, ensuring it remains protected alongside the stored passwords. Also, provide users with the option to update or change their PIN securely if needed, enhancing flexibility and control over account access.
- **Cloud Backup Option**: Allow users to back up encrypted passwords to a secure cloud storage service.
- **Password Strength Indicator**: Provide users with feedback on password strength during creation.
